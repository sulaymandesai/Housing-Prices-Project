# Housing-Prices-Project
This project required me to predict sale prices from the features of a housing dataset. I used a number of data processing techniques such as imputing missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalising features and removing outliers to clean up the training and testing data sets. Using these cleaned data sets, I fitted various machine learning models such as: Ordinary Least Squares Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Deci- sion Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor. The Ridge Regression model returned the lowest mean absolute error of 0.07871660662991475. It was found that the tree models demanded great computational cost for minimal improvements in accuracy. If this project were to be improved, I would implement feature generation to generate more useful features, used different encoding techniques for greater usage of categorical variables and would develop an ensemble of models to get the best predictions.

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook file of my project and a pdf of the completed project.
